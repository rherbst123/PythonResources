QUESTION 2: Recipe Scaling with Input Validation (20 points)
Based on: IngredientAdjuster.py and basic conditionals

Create a program that helps scale a cookie recipe. The original recipe makes 48 cookies and requires:
- 1.5 cups of sugar
- 1 cup of butter  
- 2.75 cups of flour

Your program should:
- Ask the user how many cookies they want to make

QUESTION 3: Temperature Converter with Weather Advisory (25 points)
Based on: Mathematical calculations and conditional logic 

Write a program that converts temperatures and provides weather-appropriate clothing advice. 

The program should:
- Ask the user to enter a temperature in Fahrenheit
- Convert the temperature to Celsius using: C = (F - 32) × 5/9
- Display the temperature in both Fahrenheit and Celsius (rounded to 1 decimal place)
- Provide clothing advice based on the Fahrenheit temperature:
  - Below 32°F: "Freezing! Wear heavy winter clothing and stay warm!"
  - 32-50°F: "Cold - Wear a warm jacket and layers"
  - 51-65°F: "Cool - A light jacket or sweater recommended"
  - 66-75°F: "Comfortable - Light clothing is perfect"
  - 76-85°F: "Warm - Shorts and t-shirt weather!"
  - Above 85°F: "Hot! Stay hydrated and wear light, breathable clothing"

Example Output:
Enter temperature in Fahrenheit: 68
Temperature: 68.0°F = 20.0°C
Weather advice: Comfortable - Light clothing is perfect

QUESTION 4: Advanced Sales Calculator (40 points)
Based on: SoftwareSales.py and CompoundIntrest.py concepts

Create a comprehensive sales system for a software company. The base price is $99 per package with these discount tiers:
- 10-19 packages: 10% discount
- 20-49 packages: 20% discount  
- 50-99 packages: 30% discount
- 100+ packages: 40% discount

Additionally, if the customer is a returning customer, they get an extra 5% off the final price.

Your program should:
- Ask for quantity and customer status (new/returning)
- Validate that quantity is positive
- Calculate the base cost, discount amount, and final price
- If returning customer, apply the additional 5% discount
- Display a detailed receipt showing all calculations

Example Output:
Quantity: 25
Customer type (new/returning): returning
Base cost: $2475.00
Volume discount (20%): $495.00
Subtotal: $1980.00
Returning customer discount (5%): $99.00
