#  1. Valid Number Information
#  Design a program that uses a loop to build a list named valid_numbers that contains only 
# the numbers between 0 and 100 from the numbers list below. The program should then 
# determine and display the total and average of the values in the valid_numbers list.
#  numbers = [74, 19, 105, 20, âˆ’2, 67, 77, 124, âˆ’45, 38]

numbers = [74, 19, 105, 20, -2, 67, 77, 124, -45, 38]


index = 0
for i in range(len(numbers)):
    #print(numbers[index])
    if numbers[index] > 0 and numbers[index] < 100:
        print(f"{numbers[index]} is in the good range.")
    else:
        print(f"{numbers[index]} is NOT in the good range")
    index += 1
