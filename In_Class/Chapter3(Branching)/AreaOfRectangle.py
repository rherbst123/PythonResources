# 2.  Areas of Rectangles
# The area of a rectangle is the rectangleâ€™s length times its width. Write a program that asks 
# for the length and width of two rectangles. The program should tell the user which rectan-
# gle has the greater area, or if the areas are the same.

rect1Area = rect1Width * rect1Length

rect2Area = rect2Width * rect2Length
