# 5.  Distance Traveled
# Assuming there are no accidents or delays, the distance that a car travels down the inter-
# state can be calculated with the following formula:
# Distance 5 Speed 3 Time
# A car is traveling at 70 miles per hour. Write a program that displays the following:
# • The distance the car will travel in 6 hours
# • The distance the car will travel in 10 hours
# • The distance the car will travel in 15 hours

SPEED = 70

#Distance in 6 hours 
distance6 = SPEED * 6
print(f"In 6 Hours you traveled: {distance6} miles")

#Distance in 10 hours
distance10 = SPEED * 10
print(f"In 10 Hours you traveled: {distance10} miles")

#Distance in 10 hours
distance15 = SPEED * 15
print(f"In 15 Hours you traveled: {distance15} miles")
