The evening sky was painted with vibrant colors as the sun set beyond the mountains. Stars began to appear, their light twinkling in the darkness. The town settled into a peaceful quiet, broken only by the occasional barking of dogs or distant laughter.

People gathered in the town square, sharing stories and enjoying the cool night air. The gentle breeze continued through the evening, carrying whispers and the scent of dinner being prepared in nearby homes. Children were called inside, their day of play coming to an end. The market stalls were closed, the bustling activity of the day replaced by the calm of evening.
