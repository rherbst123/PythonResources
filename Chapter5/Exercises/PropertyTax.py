""" 5. Property Tax
 A county collects property taxes on the assessment value of property, which is 60 percent of 
the propertys actual value. For example, if an acre of land is valued at $10,000, its assess
ment value is $6,000. The property tax is then 72Â¢ for each $100 of the assessment value. 
The tax for the acre assessed at $6,000 will be $43.20. Write a program that asks for the 
actual value of a piece of property and displays the assessment value and property tax. """
