""" 11. Addition Test
 Write a program that generates printable addition tests. The tests should consist of 5 ques
tions which present a simple addition question in the following format, where the question 
number goes from 1 to 5, and num1 and num2 are randomly generated numbers between 
1 and 10:
    Question 1
    num1 + num2 = _____
 The program should simply display the 5 questions â€“ it should not prompt the user for any 
input.
